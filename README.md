# Master Thesis 2021: MySQL Database Integrity Checker (FORK)
This repository contains the forked source code for the original product associated with the 2021 master thesis project at Roskilde University, written and developed by 

Danny Nielsen & Kim Meyer Albrechtsen.

This repository is intended for further development after hand-in, leaving the original repository archived.

## Running the Tool

The simplest way to run dIC is to pull the pre-packaged Docker image from Docker Hub and run it in a container:

```bash
$ docker run -it --pull=always --rm dbdness/dic
```

The above command will pull the latest changes to the image, if any, and execute the image in a container with an interactive prompt. When the `root>` prompt is visible, the dICÂ tool has been initialized succesfully. Run the `help` or `?` commands to get started.

The image comes pre-packaged with the two sample databases described in the last section of this README. To connect to them, run one of the two following commands:

**"Northwind_nofks"**

```bash
db-connect connection-string="host=localhost;database=northwind_nofks;user=demo;password=demo"
```

**"Sakila"**

```bash
db-connect connection-string="host=localhost;database=sakila;user=demo;password=demo"
```
